# MyPaths

By Grimmier

## Description: 

This script is designed to Create and Manage waypoint Paths / Loops on a per zone basis

I created this because I like to use the waypoints feature for farm hunting in RGMercs Lua, but didn't like having to remake the loop when I changed locations within the same zone.
Especially so for zones where I tend to change locations often enough.

## Features:

* Create, Save and Load Paths for the current zone.
* Create Waypoints for the path either manually or via Record Path button
* You can Delete entire Paths, Clear all waypoints or delete an individual waypoint as needed.
* Configure themes, font size, and delay between recording waypoints in auto record mode.
* Navigate the paths
* You can navigate in order, or reverse order.
* You can loop your path and start over after the end.
* If you are looping you can also set Ping Pong Mode.
* Ping Pong mode will go from A to B then B to A reversing the order at each end point.
* If you enter combat while navigating we will attempt to continue after you finish combat.
